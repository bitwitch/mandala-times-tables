# Times Tables  

![140s times table](./140.gif)  

A program that draws times tables on a circle, animating through the progression of times tables starting at 2. The structures that exist intrinsically within the generated images are hypnotic. Math is fuckin gorgeous. I wrote this first in processing, then did a rewrite in c++. The c++ version is obvs way more performant. I'm a self taught programmer and a n00b at c++.
